Question # 01: Define a class to represent a bank account. Include the following members
Data Members
Name of the depositor
Account number
Balance amount in the account
Member Function
Write setter and getter property to initialize the value of amount
To deposit an amount
To withdraw an amount after checking the balance
To display name and balance

Question # 02: Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as data members—a first name (type char*), a last name (type string) and a monthly salary (type int). Your class should have a setter function that initializes the three data members. Provide a getter function for each data member. If the monthly salary is not positive, set it to 0. Write a test program that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10 percent raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again. Identify and add any other related functions to achieve the said goal.

Question # 03: Create a class name student having data members: student name, roll no and four subject marks
Write a member function to:
Input student name, roll no and marks of subjects
Calculate percentage
Display all information
Write a main function to test the program
STEP1: start the program
STEP2: define class student and define data member function and member variable.
STEP3: use cin and cout to take value by user and put text on screen respectively
STEP 4: stop

Question # 04: Define a class for a type called CounterType. An object of this type is used to count things, so it records a count that is a nonnegative whole number. Include a mutator function that sets the counter to a count given as an argument. Include member functions to increase the count by one and to decrease the count by one. Also, include a member function that returns the current count value and one that outputs the count. Embed your class definition in a test program.
